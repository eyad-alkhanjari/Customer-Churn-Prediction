# **Telecom Customer Churn Prediction**

## **Purpose**
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry. Churn occurs when customers stop using a company's service. The goal is to:
- Analyze telecom data to uncover patterns behind churn.
- Build a predictive model to identify customers likely to leave.
- Help companies retain customers and reduce financial losses.

## **Tools and Libraries Used**

### **Data Manipulation and Analysis**
- **Pandas**: For handling and analyzing datasets.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.

### **Data Visualization**
- **Matplotlib**: For creating basic plots like histograms and bar charts.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced visualization, including scatterplots and heatmaps.

### **Machine Learning**
- **Scikit-learn**: For encoding, scaling, and building predictive models.

### **Development Environment**
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used as the environment for coding and presenting findings.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis and model development.

## **Key Steps Involved**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze the dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships.
   - Use visualizations like count charts, histograms, and scatterplots to gain insights.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Scale numerical features to enhance model performance.

3. **Model Building:**
   - Implement machine learning techniques to predict churn.

4. **Results Presentation:**
   - Summarize insights into patterns contributing to churn.
   - Present model performance and actionable recommendations.

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how data analysis, visualization, and machine learning can be effectively combined to address real-world business challenges, such as customer retention in the telecom sector.
